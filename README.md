🧩 Sudoku Game | Java & Web Development
=======================================

📌 Project Description
----------------------

**Sudoku Game** is a **Java-based project** that combines **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** with a **web-based frontend** for an interactive Sudoku experience.

The project includes **puzzle generation, validation, and solving logic**, along with a **clean HTML/CSS interface**. It is designed to be both **educational** and **practical**, demonstrating real-world algorithmic problem-solving.

🚀 Why This Project Matters
---------------------------

*   Demonstrates **backtracking and recursion** in a real-world puzzle.
    
*   Strengthens **DSA skills**, including **matrix validation** and **logical problem-solving**.
    
*   Combines **backend logic** with **frontend UI**, ideal for learning **full-stack integration**.
    
*   Serves as a **portfolio project** or **practice project** for interviews and coding challenges.
    

🏗️ High-Level Architecture
---------------------------

### Backend (Java)

*   Core Sudoku logic implemented in **Java**, including:
    
    *   **2D arrays** to represent the grid
        
    *   **Backtracking algorithm** to solve puzzles
        
    *   **Recursive exploration** of valid number placements
        
*   Puzzle validation checks **rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-grids**.
    

### Frontend (Web)

*   Static **HTML/CSS** files for UI
    
*   Interactive grid where users can input numbers and see validation results
    
*   Minimalistic **clean design** for better user experience
    

🧠 Algorithms & Concepts
------------------------

*   **Backtracking Algorithm** – explores possibilities recursively to solve puzzles
